## Regret Analysis

- A player chooses an action ${\theta}^{(t)}\in K$ every $t$ period, where K is a feasible set of actions.

- The cost function $f^{(t)}$ determines the cost $f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})$ for action $\theta^{(t)}$.

- The player decides his action based on the strategy.


## Regret Analysis

- How does the player choose an action which minimizes a total cost $\Sigma f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})$?

- Can the cost function be minimized even if it is not unknown?

- We introduce a regret about the strategy.

\begin{df}[Regret]
The difference between the total cost of an action based on a strategy $A$ and the total cost of the optimal strategy $\theta^{*}$ is defined as the regret $Regret(A)$ of strategy $A$.
\begin{align}
Regret(A)=\Sigma^{T}_{t=1} f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})-\Sigma^{T}_{t=1} f^{(t)}(\theta^{*}) \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{df}


## Regret Analysis

Regret analysis in online learning

- Let action be the parameter of the online learner ${\pmb \theta}^{(t)}\in \mathbb R^{m}$ given the training data $({\pmb x}^{(t)},y^{(t)})$.

- Let the cost function be a loss function $f^{(t)}=({\pmb x}^{(t)},y^{(t)},{\pmb \theta})$.

- In this case, the optimal strategy is the strategy that chooses the action that minimizes the cost function for all training data.


## Follow the Leader

- At first, We consider strategy for choosing action that minimizes the total cost to date.

\begin{align}
{\pmb \theta}^{(t)} = \argmin_{{\pmb \theta}\in K}\Sigma_{i=1}^{t-1} f^{(t)}({\pmb \theta}) \nonumber
\end{align}

- This strategy is called Follow the Leader (FTL).

## Follow the Reader

- However, there are cases where FTK doesn't work.

- Consider action $\theta \in [-1,1]$ and cost function $f^{(t)}(\theta)=(1/2)(-1)^{t}\theta$.

- In this case, the action goes back and forth between $-1$ and $1$ except for the first, as $\theta^{(1)}=0, \theta^{(2)}=-1, \theta^{(2)}=1,...$.

- The cost function is $1/2$ except for the first, as $f^{(1)}(\theta^{(1)})=0,f^{(2)}(\theta^{(2)})=1/2,f^{(3)}(\theta^{(3)})=1/2,...$.

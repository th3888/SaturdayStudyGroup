## Regret Analysis

- A player chooses an action ${\theta}^{(t)}\in K$ every $t$ period. K is a feasible set of actions.

- The cost function $f^{(t)}$ determines the cost $f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})$ for action $\theta^{(t)}$.

- The player decides his action based on the strategy.


## Regret Analysis

- How does the player choose an action which minimizes a total cost $\Sigma f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})$?

- Can the cost function be minimized even if it is not unknown?

- We introduce a regret about the strategy.

\begin{df}[Regret]
The difference between the total cost of an action based on a strategy $A$ and the total cost of the optimal strategy $\theta^{*}$ is defined as the regret $Regret(A)$ of strategy $A$.
\begin{align}
Regret(A)=\Sigma^{T}_{t=1} f^{(t)}(\theta^{(t)})-\Sigma^{T}_{t=1} f^{(t)}(\theta^{*}) \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{df}
